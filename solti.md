# SOLTI - Systems Oriented Laboratory Testing & Integration

## Overview
SOLTI provides a comprehensive framework for testing and integrating system components in a controlled environment. The project emphasizes methodical testing, system behavior analysis, and component integration.

## Name Origin
- **S**ystems: Managing and testing system-of-systems
- **O**riented: Structured and purposeful approach
- **L**aboratory: Controlled testing environment
- **T**esting: Verification and validation
- **I**ntegration: Component interconnection and interaction

Named after Sir Georg Solti, renowned for his precise and analytical conducting style.
